## Description
PacketEntityAPI is an API designed to allow simple modification and creation of entities. It provides a listener which fires events whenever packets are sent to modify entities and allows them to be modified.

## Compatibility and Dependencies
PacketEntityAPI currently *requires* ProtocolLib. There are no known incompatibilities.

## Commands and Permissions
PacketEntityAPI does not have any commands or permissions.

## API Usage
PacketEntityAPI is designed as an API. It is not meant to be used as a plugin on its own. API documentation is available [here](http://iso2013.github.io/PacketEntityAPI/javadocs/). To get started, [click here](https://github.com/iso2013/PacketEntityAPI/wiki).

## Support the Project

I will be taking a two year hiatus from Minecraft development, so I've written up a guide on how to update this project. See the wiki for more information. (This should, hopefully also work the other way! If someone wants to add legacy support, I'd be alright with that, as long as it does not interfere with functionality on the latest version!)

If you appreciate the work I've put into this project, please consider donating:
